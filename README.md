# Goubau Line Simulation

This repository contains electromagnetic simulations and scripts used to study the propagation modes and surface wave behavior in Goubau lines. This work was developed as part of graduate research at UBC.

## Contents
- ✅ Ansys HFSS simulation files
- ✅ Python/Matlab scripts for field processing
- ✅ Sample S-parameter plots and mode profiles

## Requirements
- Ansys Electronics Desktop (HFSS)
- Python 3.10 (optional)
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. Open `/ansys-models/goubau.aedt` in HFSS.
2. Simulate the `Mode1` setup.
3. Use `/scripts/plot_sparams.py` to visualize S21 and field distributions.
